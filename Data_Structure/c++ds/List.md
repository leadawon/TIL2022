## what is List?
A list is a homogeneous collection of elements, with a
linear relationship between elements. 


That is, each list element (except the first) has a unique
predecessor, and each element (except the last) has a
unique successor.

## two kinds of List
* UNSORTED LIST
  * Elements are placed into
the list in
no particular order.


* SORTED LIST
  * List elements are in an
order that is sorted in
some way -- either
numerically or
alphabetically by the
15
elements themselves, or
by a component of the
element (called a **KEY**
member) .
